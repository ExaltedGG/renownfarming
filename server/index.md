[![Server Info](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WolfHQ/renownfarming/gh-pages/images/homeinfo.png)](https://wolfhq.github.io/renownfarming/server)

We are a Discord gaming community primarily providing an LFG platform for Rainbow Six Siege players who are farming renown, the game's virtual currency, or grinding the Battlepass and any available challenges.

Below is a list of information regarding the Discord server including the different roles and channels featured in the server.

If anyone experiences any issues or have concerns, do not hesitate to open a ticket. Our moderation team will be happy to help and answer any and all of your questions.

![Roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WolfHQ/renownfarming/gh-pages/images/infofeatures.png)

### Temporary User-Generated Voice and Text Channels
To make looking for a squad easier, members are given access to create their own temporary voice and text channels for their gaming session. Both voice and text channels are automatically created so if you don't like to use the former, you can simply mute/deafen the Voice Channel. These channels will also be automatically deleted once the last member of the Voice Channel disconnects.

### Temporary Self-Assignable Booster Role
Do you have a booster activated but don't want to periodically check the LFG channels for potential squadmates? You can assign yourself a temporary role that will automatically unassign after 12 hours. You can also unassign it earlier by manually unreacting on the appropriate post.

### Farmer Prestige Reputation System
We have implemented a reputation system for the server. All members are eligible to give and receive reputation points based on their performance during a game session. As members increase the number of points they have received, they will also gain specific roles to reflect how awesome of a teammate they are. A list of the Prestige roles are available below.

### Ticket Reporting
We want to keep a healthy and friendly community so every member of the server can open a ticket to reach out to all the server moderators and administrators should they have any problems, questions, reports, or just want to talk.

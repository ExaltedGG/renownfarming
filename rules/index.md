[![Rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WolfHQ/renownfarming/gh-pages/images/homerules.png)](https://wolfhq.github.io/renownfarming/rules)

As an international gaming community, we strive to keep our server friendly and welcoming to everyone and to help us achieve that, we have a rudimentary set of rules and etiquette that our voluntary team of moderators are enforcing. These sets of guidelines are not exhaustive and only provide a framework of the general expected behaviour for all our members.

If anyone experiences any issues or have concerns, do not hesitate to open a ticket. Our moderation team will be happy to help and answer any and all of your questions.

![Server Rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WolfHQ/renownfarming/gh-pages/images/rulesserver.png)

Server rules apply across the whole server including all interactions within and originating from it.

Any attempt to circumvent any of the rules or exploit loopholes will trigger immediate moderator actions.

### 1 - Be civil to and considerate of your fellow community members.
- That means that we expect no toxicity, targeted vulgarity, harassment, or any untoward behaviour towards other users in the server. 
- Any form of hate speech including, but not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia will not be tolerated and may get you banned from the server immediately without warning. 

### 2. No political, religious, or any sensitive/controversial discussions.
- We are, first and foremost, a gaming community and such content and types of discussions do not concern that.
- Avoid any form of drama at all costs. Should any argument ensue, do not escalate and call Moderators for an intervention.

### 3 - Do not antagonise or further provoke users exhibiting toxic behaviour.
- "Do not feed the trolls." as they say.
- If you encounter any toxic activity, report them to us immediately (preferably with screenshots/video especially if they occurred outside the server).

### 4 - No advertisements or promotions of any kind.
- The server is not a marketplace.
- Do not post messages with the purpose selling or buying game accounts, cheats and other products, or services such as account boosting. 
- Do not ask for money, real or virtual, from any of the members in any of the channels or through direct messaging.
- You cannot promote any server, community, social media accounts, and any streaming channels without permission and prior approval from the Server Administrators.

### 5 - Do not Direct Message other users for unrelated reasons unless they specifically told you.
- Try to keep all communication within the server. 
- Many of our members do not like receiving random DMs from strangers and most of the time, for no reason. Should you be a recipient of such, we encourage you to open a ticket and report the offending user.
- This can also help moderators monitor and immediately check any incidents should they happen.

### 6 - No reputation trading or any manipulation of the reputation system.
- If you're actually a decent human being and teammate, you will get the points you deserve. 
- We have observed several instances of these and have applied impromptu admin actions for such. But we are now standardising this rule and will have a specific set of penalties for any suspicious rep activity.
- Only server admins can remove points from members.

### 7 - No NSFW content.
- Do not post nor discuss any content or topic that can be considered NSFW.

### 8 - Do not spam the @Active Booster role or anything else.
- Slowmode will be activated on most channels.
- Do not abuse bot commands, no excess use of emojis and/or special characters, and tagging random users and @everyone or @here.
- Do not jump through different voice channels within a short amount of time or spam soundboards/voice mods or any unnecessary and loud noises in voice chats.

### 9 - Take note of the server channels and their purpose.
- Most of the channel names are self-explanatory. If these are not enough, there are descriptions on the channel topic.
- Only post relevant information or topics based on the channel you're in.

### 10 - English is the only language to be used in all public channels.
- Yes, we are an international community but most, if not all, of our members speak and understand English. So, why not use a language that everyone can use?


![Game Rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WolfHQ/renownfarming/gh-pages/images/rulesgame.png)

### 1 - Do not teamkill.
- We do not condone any form of intentional teamkilling unless you were specifically asked to do so or if it was obviously accidental.
- We encourage everyone to report users they have played with that have done such actions. Please include supporting documents such as screenshots, video recording, and chat history.

### 2 - Do not AFK without a valid reason.
- Even though we're only playing against AI, this is still a team game and we expect every member of our team to be pulling their weight.
- Bathroom/Drink/Snack breaks are totally okay and even encouraged; just let your squad know and do so within a reasonable amount of time.

### 3 - Make sure to have a booster activated when joining a booster squad.
- Don't waste other people's time and don't lie about it either.

### 4 - Play the game. No lollygagging.
- When you're in a squad, your mates expect you to play the game. That is, kill the enemies and go for the objective.
- Do not intentionally block your teammates, lead the hostage around the map, or kill the hostage.

### 5. No spawn camping.
- Unless your whole squad is fine with it, don't camp and only wait for the reinforment AI to spawn. That's what the claymores are for.
- We perceive this to be similar to being AFK without a valid reason and a lazy and leech move.


![Recommendations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WolfHQ/renownfarming/gh-pages/images/rulesrec.png)

### 1. Use your IGN as your server nickname.
- Setting your Ubisoft, PSN, or XBL gamer tags as your visible name in the server will help other users quickly identify and add you.
- Make your nicknames simple and easily taggable. Names that contain excessive special characters will be removed by moderators.
- Nicknames that contain insults, slurs, or anything that attempts to impersonate anyone will result in an immediate ban.

### 2. Do not leave your squad hanging.
- If possible, give your squad advance notice if you are about to leave a session so you can give them ample time to find your replacement and continue playing with full bonus uninterrupted.

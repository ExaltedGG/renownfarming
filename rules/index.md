[![Rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WolfHQ/renownfarming/gh-pages/images/homerules.png)](https://wolfhq.github.io/renownfarming/rules)

As an international gaming community, we strive to keep our server friendly and welcoming to everyone and to help us achieve that, we have a rudimentary set of rules and etiquette that our voluntary team of moderators are enforcing. These sets of guidelines are not exhaustive and only provide a framework of the general expected behaviour for all our members.

If anyone experiences any issues or have concerns, do not hesitate to open a ticket. Our moderation team will be happy to help and answer any and all of your questions.

![Server Rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WolfHQ/renownfarming/gh-pages/images/rulesserver.png)

### 1 - Be civil to and considerate of your fellow community members.
- That means that we expect no toxicity, targeted vulgarity, harassment, or any untoward behaviour towards other users in the server. 
- Any form of hate speech including, but not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia will not be tolerated and may get you banned from the server immediately without warning. 
- We also insist on avoiding posting any political, religious, or any sensitive topics. We are, first and foremost, a gaming community and such content and types of discussions are not directly related to that.

### 2 - Do not antagonise or further provoke users exhibiting toxic behaviour.
- "Do not feed the trolls." as they say.
- If you encounter any toxic activity, report them to us immediately (preferably with screenshots/video).

### 3 - No advertisements or promotions of any kind.
- The server is not a marketplace.
- Do not post messages with the purpose selling or buying game accounts, cheats and other products, or services such as account boosting. 
- Do not ask for money, real or virtual, from any of the members in any of the channels or through direct messaging.
- You cannot promote any server, community, social media accounts, and any streaming channels without permission and prior approval from the Server Administrators.

### 4 - Do not Direct Message other users for unrelated reasons unless they specifically told you.
- Try to keep all communication within the server. 
- Many of our members do not like receiving random DMs from strangers and most of the time, for no reason. Should you be a recipient of such, we encourage you to open a ticket and report the offending user.
- This can also help moderators monitor and immediately check any incidents should they happen.

### 5 - No reputation trading or any manipulation of the reputation system.
- If you're actually a decent human being and teammate, you will get the points you deserve. 
- We have observed several instances of these and have applied impromptu admin actions for such. But we are now standardising this rule and will have a specific set of penalties for any suspicious rep activity.

### 6 - No NSFW content.
- Do not post nor discuss any content or topic that can be considered NSFW.

### 7 - Do not spam the @Active Booster role or anything else.
- Slowmode will be activated on most channels.
- Do not abuse bot commands, no excess use of emojis and/or special characters, jumping active voice channels, and tagging random users and @everyone or @here.

### 8 - Take note of the server channels and their purpose.
- Most of the channel names are self-explanatory. If these are not enough, there are descriptions on the channel topic.
- Only post relevant information or topics based on the channel you're in.


![Game Rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WolfHQ/renownfarming/gh-pages/images/rulesgame.png)

### 1 - Do not teamkill.
- We do not condone any form of intentional teamkilling unless you were specifically asked to do so or if it was obviously accidental.
- We encourage everyone to report users they have played with that have done such actions. Please include supporting documents such as screenshots, video recording, and chat history.

### 2 - Do not AFK without a valid reason.
- Even though we're only playing against AI, this is still a team game and we expect every member of our team to be pulling their weight.
- Bathroom/Drink/Snack breaks are totally okay and even encouraged; just let your squad know and do so within a reasonable amount of time.

### 3 - Make sure to have a booster activated when joining a booster squad.
- Don't waste other people's time and don't lie about it either.

### 4 - Play the game. No lollygagging.
- When you're in a squad, your mates expect you to play the game. That is, kill the enemies and go for the objective.
- Do not intentionally block your teammates, lead the hostage around the map, or kill the hostage.

### 5. No spawn camping.
- Unless your whole squad is fine with it, don't camp and wait for the reinforment AI to spawn. That's what the claymores or for.
- We perceive this to be similar to being AFK without a valid reason and a lazy and leech move.

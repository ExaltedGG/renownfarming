[![Rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WolfHQ/renownfarming/gh-pages/images/homerules.png)](https://wolfhq.github.io/renownfarming/rules)

As an international gaming community, we strive to keep our server friendly and welcoming to everyone and to help us achieve that, we have a rudimentary set of rules and etiquette that our voluntary team of moderators are enforcing. These sets of guidelines are not exhaustive and only provide a framework of the general expected behaviour for all our members.

If anyone experiences any issues or have concerns, do not hesitate to open a ticket. Our moderation team will be happy to help and answer any and all of your questions.

![Server Rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WolfHQ/renownfarming/gh-pages/images/rulesserver.png)

### 1 - **Be civil to and considerate of your fellow community members.**
- That means that we expect no toxicity, targeted vulgarity, harassment, or any untoward behaviour towards other users in the server. 
- Any form of hate speech including, but not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia will not be tolerated and may get you banned from the server immediately without warning. 
- We also insist on avoiding posting any political, religious, or any sensitive topics. We are, first and foremost, a gaming community and such content and types of discussions are not directly related to that.

### 2 - **No advertisements or promotions of any kind.**
- The server is not a marketplace.
- Do not post messages with the purpose selling or buying game accounts, cheats and other products, or services such as account boosting. 
- Do not ask for money, real or virtual, from any of the members in any of the channels or through direct messaging.
- You cannot promote any server, community, social media accounts, and any streaming channels without permission and prior approval from the Server Administrators.

### 3 - **Do not Direct Message other users for unrelated reasons unless they specifically told you.**
- Try to keep all communication within the server. 
- Many of our members do not like receiving random DMs from strangers and most of the time, for no reason. Should you be a recipient of such, we encourage you to open a ticket and report the offending user.
- This can also help moderators monitor and immediately check any incidents should they happen.

### 4 - **No reputation trading or any manipulation of the reputation system.**
- If you're actually a decent human being and teammate, you will get the points you deserve. 
- We have observed several instances of these and have applied impromptu admin actions for such. But we are now standardising this rule and will have a specific set of penalties for any suspicious rep activity.

### 5 - No NSFW content.
- Do not post nor discuss any content or topic that can be considered NSFW.
